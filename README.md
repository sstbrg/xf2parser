# XTR-BT Parsing and Analysis tools

# Installation
### Prerequisites:

1. Python 3.8 (stable), 64-bit only.
2. Python virtual environment with pip.

### Installation steps:

1. Open a new python project.
2. Create a python virtual environment (using virtualenv, pipenv, anaconda and so on...) and activate it. We recommend using venv.
3. Run the following:

		pip install wheel git+https://bitbucket.org/xtrodesalgorithms/xtr-bt.git

*Note: you do not need to clone this repo, pip will download and install everything automatically.*

*Note: if "pip install gitpython" doesn't work, try "pip install git".*

# Uninstallation
From the relevant virtual environment, run the following:

		pip uninstall xtrbt
